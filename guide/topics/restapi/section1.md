## Start Here

Let's get started shall we?

### Welcome

Welcome to Section 1 of our MenuDocs HTML/CSS/JS Webguide. Section 1 is all about making our first HTML Code and this section is based 100% off of HTML Code. At the end of the section you can embark upon Section 2 and so on!

First things first we need to start our project, Just make a folder and open it up in the code editor of your choice!

Ok first things first, We need to set up our file structure. HTML files are just indexed with the .html suffix, So our first page being **index.html**. Next up let's create another folder. This folder is going to be called **pages**. As I said we are making multiple pages inside of our webpage in this guide. So in this pages folder we are only going to make one page named **page1.html**. Now we have no code inside either of these pages yet, but we will get there in the next section, Enjoy the guide!
