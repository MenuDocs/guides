A guide for the basics of any and all Web Development

### Basis of concept

Here is your start to Web Development, If you would like a video guide, I built one on the MenuDocs Channel at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWnw41ah3I4ZWMIAVEEMg97i6aOwwqFxF). Our Video Series is much slower than the guide you see here. I will be packing more information into each page, that way you can get more and more complex with your websites. I will also be including some code that didn't make it into the plans for the Video Series. All the code for each page will be put on the bottom of the page, you can find the whole repository [here](https://github.com/MelodicAlbuild/menudocsguides/tree/master/Web%20Dev).
