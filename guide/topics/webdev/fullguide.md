Here is your start to Web Development, If you would like a video guide, I built one on the MenuDocs Channel at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWnw41ah3I4ZWMIAVEEMg97i6aOwwqFxF). Our Video Series is much slower than the guide you see here. I will be packing more information into each page, that way you can get more and more complex with your websites. I will also be including some code that didn't make it into the plans for the Video Series. All the code for each page will be put on the bottom of the page, you can find the whole repository [here](https://github.com/MelodicAlbuild/menudocsguides/tree/master/Web%20Dev).

As for how our guide here works, Each Key Resource you will see is divided into sections, [Section 1](section1.md) is all about your basics to HTML and Basic Web Design. [Section 2](section2.md) is all about CSS with some more complex HTML Elements. Our Guide Intermission<!-- [Guide Intermission](guideintermission.md) --> is all about building up the terrible looking chaos that is your first learning portion of the website and making it into something more appealing. Section 3<!-- [Section 3](section3.md) --> is about Javascript with Web Development. Javascript gets complicated here and we will use very advanced HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build up each part of our website. I'd recommend checking out our Javascript Guide<!-- [Javascript Guide](/topics/javascript) --> (This does not exist yet), so you can learn basic Javascript First!
