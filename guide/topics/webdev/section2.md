## Start Here

Let's get started shall we?

Our First Page here will be all about making your first document and setting up a file structure for multiple pages of HTML.

First things first we need to start our project, Just make a folder and open it up in the code editor of your choice!

Ok first things first, We need to set up our file structure. HTML files are just indexed with the .html suffix, So our first page being **index.html**. Next up let's create another folder. This folder is going to be called **pages**. As I said we are making multiple pages inside of our webpage in this guide. So in this pages folder we are only going to make one page named **page1.html**. Now we have no code inside either of these pages yet, but we will get there in the next section, Enjoy the guide!

## Initial Code

Now that we have a structure, We are actually going to code something! <br>
To clarify, I will show the completed code at the end of each section, if you would like to see each piece at a time, they are linked to their respective reference page.

### Starting Code
To start let's crack open that **index.html** and get to work! Starting off we need our [HTML Doctype Declaration](reference.html#html-doctype-declaration), This is done super simply with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```. Next up is the [html](reference.html#html) tag. Everything will go in here! We will also add in a [head](reference.html#head) tag. This head tag, for now, will just contain our [title](reference.html#title) tag. Our total code looks like this,
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head> 
            <title>Our Website</title>
        </head>
    </html>
```
